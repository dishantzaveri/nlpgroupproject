Adjust the lighting: The source image has a darker sky, which suggests that the lighting needs to be adjusted to create a more dramatic and vibrant sunset or sunrise effect. This can be achieved by increasing the exposure or using a photo editing tool to add a gradient of colors to the sky.\n\n2. Enhance the colors: The target image has a more saturated and vivid color palette, especially in the sky. To achieve this, the source image's colors can be enhanced using photo editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom, by increasing the saturation and vibrancy sliders.\n\n3.
